# NFT-Marketplace
This fictional project aims to create a secure authentication system for physical products using NFTs and blockchain technology. The system includes a virtual showroom in the metaverse and a secure platform for transactions.

### Key Features:
- Physical product selection and NFT creation
- QR code or NFC chip integration for product linking
- Digital twin creation for each physical product
- Unique NFT generation associated with the digital twin
- Metadata inclusion (title, description, image) for each NFT
- Private or marketplace NFT sales

### Proof of Concept:
- Virtual showroom accessible in a metaverse environment
- Secure redirection to a transaction platform for purchases
- Each product linked to an unforgeable NFT
- Guaranteed product authenticity for customers
- Resale capability in the second-hand market with NFT certificate transfer

This system ensures product authenticity, enables secure transactions, and facilitates ownership transfer in the secondary market.
